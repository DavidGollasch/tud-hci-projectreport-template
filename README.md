# TUD-HCI-ProjectReport
LaTeX template for writing project reports at TU Dresden, Human-Computer Interaction

## How to Use
1. Download or fork this project
2. Open report.tex (root document) with your favourite LaTeX editor
3. Follow the steps in the TODO-comments
	- Configure your document
	- Get an overview of what's in the package
4. Pay attention on compiling instructions to avoid errors
	- I recommend XeLaTeX for compiling
	- Use Biber for bibliography rendering instead of BibTeX
	
## Custom Fonts
This template comprises a set of custom fonts enabled by default. If you prefer LaTeX's default Latin Modern font family, open the _includes/commands.tex_ file and remove the section below the _Custom Fonts_ comment including the _linespread_ command as well as the three _set****font_ commands.
